# hello oauth

A small demo of oauth with GitHub and pseudo-authentication with JWTs.

## Getting started

- Clone this repo
- `cd` into the project directory and run `npm intall`
- start server and client in development mode with `npm run dev`
- Checkout the `github-oauth` and `jwt` branches. Happy hacking!
